# Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables.

There are various kinds of regression techniques available to make predictions. These techniques are mostly driven by three metrics (number of independent variables, type of dependent variables and shape of regression line).

## 1. Linear Regression

## 2. Logistic Regression

## 3. Polynomial Regression

## 4. Stepwise Regression

## 5. Ridge Regression

## 6. Lasso Regression

## 7. ElasticNet Regression

# Model evaluation 

Model evaluation leads a Data Scientist in the right direction to select or tune an appropriate model.There are three main errors (metrics) used to evaluate regression models, Mean absolute error, Mean Squared error and R2 score.

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** tells us the average error in units of y, the predicted feature. A value of 0 indicates a perfect fit. 

**Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** indicates the average error in units of y, the predicted feature, but penalizes larger errors more severely than MAE. A value of 0 indicates a perfect fit. 

**R-squared (R2 )** tells us the degree to which the model explains the variance in the data. In other words how much better it is than just predicting the mean. 
+ A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit.
+ A value of 0 indicates a model no better than the mean. 
+ A value less than 0 indicates a model worse than just predicting the mean.
